                        This project was part of the 2021 Kenny Game Jam where the challenge of the event was to create a game around the concept of rotation. We also had to only use art assets from Kenny, although they could be modified anyway we saw fit. We had 48 hours for the jam spanning 3 days.

                        We developed a puzzle game based on the sokoban genre where the player has to navigate levels to reach a goal while avoiding obstacles. The catch is that the floor is iced over and the player can move their character in one direction until they hit a wall and stop. The rotation concept comes into play with the player being able to control the rotation of the level at 90 degree intervals.

                        Because our team consisted of a designer and programmer, we had to develop the concept and design of the game as quickly as possible to give the programmer as much time as possible. Overall the process started with breaking down the jam challenge concept and defining a game concept. We then developed the design of the game, settling on the main gameplay loop and the mechanics involved. From there we split up our responsibilities where I focused on level design and development as well as aesthetics of the game.

                        We started by breaking down the jam challenge concept of rotation and identifying related keywords. From those keywords we looked to find genres of games with game examples that featured the keywords. We settled with a puzzler using rotation as the main solving mechanic due to time available.

                        Designing the levels was certainly a challenge as it was my first time doing so. My goal with the stages was to scale the difficulty as the player progressed. The early stages would be dedicated to teaching the rules and mechanics of the game, building up to the final stages that combined all the mechanics with significant challenges.

                    <p>
                        I started with sketching the stages out on paper, planning a desired solution path to clear a stage. As I progressed, it started to become harder to plan the levels on paper as the solutions and mechanics became more complex. I opted to note general requirements of each stage and experiment in the level editor of our engine.

                        Taking over from the designing phase, I played around with the level editor starting stages with an ideal solvable path. I then filled in the extra spaces with potential obstacles like dead ends or pitfalls. To ensure the quality of the level, I would test it as much as possible to find breakpoints in the design. Once I was satisfied with the level, I moved onto the next stage.

                        After the stages were complete, I worked on some extra features for the game to improve the quality. Adding a main menu, stage selector, controls list and escape hatch/quit button.

                        We received a lot of positive feedback along with some considerations and criticism. Many participants stated that the game was fun and the design was interesting. Expectedly the criticism we received regarded bugs and some confusion regarding mechanics. The rotation was hard for players to interpret quickly, but once they understood how it worked they were very satisfied.

                        The main takeaway is user testing, to do a lot more of it. I wasnâ€™t too concerned about it during the jam as we were pressed for time to ensure the game was complete, so flaws were accepted. However, this is an important case for other games or design projects; user testing should never be overlooked and it should be conducted thoroughly. For another jam, Iâ€™d probably incorporate people external to the project to try the game during development to catch issues Iâ€™d overlook due to familiarity with the concept.

                    <p>
                        Another big takeaway is regarding planning and how it can help make our time very efficient. We dedicated the remaining hours of the first day to really nail what our game concept was and what the game design would be. This allowed both of us to quickly proceed with our individual contributions and work without too much dependency on the otherâ€™s work. It worked very naturally for us, as when I was roughly beginning to hit my limitation on paper prototyping, the level editor and core mechanics were ready for use. I attribute this to how complete our game was for submission to the jam.

                        I hope to participate in more game jams or game projects to develop my game design skills and challenge myself to pick up new techniques or skills.
