                        During the winter module of my first year at The Hague University of Applied Sciences, we were tasked - in our Interaction Design course - to review, design and create a redesign for A Dutch Webstore. The focus of this assignment was to implement Effective interaction design patterns into our general User Experience redesign. Our design had to be motivated by a research phase in the form of an expert review of the webstore -  a breakdown of pain points in the design based on the patterns.
                        <br>The interaction design patterns were derived from the book <i>“Designing Interfaces - Patterns for Effective Interaction Design Third Edition”</i>, Written by: Jenifer Tidwell, Charles Brewer and Aynne Valencia.

                        The prototype we designed features several interaction design patterns, like the Carousel or a Thumbnail Grid. The overall layout of the webstore had been updated to fit current modern patterns. The style of the store had also been changed, to better suit a more “Dutch” identity.
                        <br>Our prototype supports a general webstore use case for guests, new visitors and recurring shoppers.

                        Our expert review of the webstore was that it had several glaring usability issues, despite that it was still functional. For our report, we had to showcase examples of usability issues within a selected list of interaction design patterns. We finally determined the overall structure of the website was good, but it had a more business centric design over user centric. 
                        <br>We sought to remove, rearrange and add new features and bring forth the Dutch culture while ensuring that navigation is fast and pleasing to the user.

                        We began the process by defining which pages would represent certain interaction design patterns, a process intended for grading purposes. We also needed to define conceptual use of a set amount of patterns from five specific chapters in the book.

                        With our selection of patterns determined, we set off to create a wireframe prototype that defines the layout and usability of our design. We designed for a flow that would take the user from the homepage, to a list of products followed by a product detail page concluding with the checkout procedure that includes an alternate flow for guests or recurring users.

                        Due to this assignment concerning more about the application of patterns, user testing was omitted from the project. This meant we moved forward on the process of developing a Hi-Fi prototype starting with a Style Tile. Here is where we defined what would represent the “Dutch Culture” which we chose would be the national color of Orange as the primary color. We also defined how certain interactions would alter element styles.

                <div class = "textBackground">
                    <p>
                        Finally we created our Hi-Fi prototype which was a mostly straight forward process. Due to proper foresight in our wireframing phase, we made sure to define components within the prototyping software. This allowed us to make small changes that would reflect over the entire design and existing interactions. What did consume a lot of time during this process - is what my project partner called - “Pixel Pushing”. We spent a significant amount of time arranging the positions of all the elements, which we felt was rewarded in the polish of our prototype.

                        My main takeaway from this project was the planning involved before creating prototypes. Spending time to list out what needs to be created and why, along with a description of how it would roughly look like. Additionally - creating the prototypes using components early on - allowed for rapid and fluid iterations, even during the transition from wireframes to Hi-Fi. Whenever I could afford to do it for a project, I’ve developed a planning document to define a scope and direction for designs and prototypes.
