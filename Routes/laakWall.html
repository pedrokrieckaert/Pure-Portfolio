                        The final major school project during the fall module of my 3rd and last year at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. The focus of this project was to give us our first full experience with the Scrum working structure. Up until then, we’ve only been working in Waterfall or half-baked Scrum. We were again tasked to work on a project with a client - them being The City Archive of The Hague - and design whatever we saw fit to satisfy their brief.
                        <br>The problem statement of this project was: The district of Laak in The Hague has seen many changes over the years, specifically the people.

                        We designed a physical installation - with digital interactions - called the “My Laak Wall” (The Wall). The Wall would be a large display located in a public area that would show a collage of user submitted images of Laak.

                        As explained, the educational assignment goal was to learn and use Scrum as best as possible and to document our journey to learning it. This was a tough challenge to overcome as we were very used to the waterfall project structure - sequentially following an order of research phase, concept phase, design phase and a prototype/testing/iteration phases. To now be given a project - with total freedom on what we deliver - it was hard at first, to just start designing without a researched use case.

                        Initially - in our first “sprint” - we attempted to define a user group and conduct research to empathise and find some needs that we could design for. This process would’ve taken too long for the available project time and we simply had to drop the approach and make a stab in the dark on a concept. In a short period of time we designed several concepts and prototypes and conducted a pitch during a demo to determine a concept they’re interested in. It was here where “My Laak Wall” originated.

                        Our goal for this sprint was to refine our concept and account for features we could only explain during our pitch. We started with a fresh batch of user stories that were more insync with our new concept - which allowed us to generate tasks focused on design and testing. We still cast our net of stories quite wide to account for multiple assumptions we generated during our Sprint 1 research. The product owner would prioritize these stories - which determined which we’d take into the sprint - settling on a broad variety of features.

                        Now finally working with scrum - including daily standups - we successfully managed to complete the majority of the tasks we set. We demonstrated our new prototype to stakeholders and received a lot of positive feedback that would help further refine our user stories for the final sprint.

                        Being the last sprint - our goal was to refine our Hi-Fi prototype as much as possible. We started with a discussion of the remaining existing user stories and whether or not they are still relevant to our project direction - if they could be adjusted to fit. We also created some new stories based on the feedback from the demo. These were then again prioritized for the sprint, although we were confident that we could finish nearly all of them in the sprint.
