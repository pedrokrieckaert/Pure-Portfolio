                        The project should allow me to demonstrate mastery over the competencies of the UXD course and the ability to function on a Bachelor level. The scope should fit to 15 weeks/ 75 days to produce products in a company setting.
                        <br>
                        The competencies - as a result, the design phases - should all be covered in the project. Still a project can have a stronger focus on design over research and vica versa.

                        For this project I have to demonstrate my mastery of the professional competencies of the User Experience Design program. Therefore - a practice based assignment/project - should adhere to the competencies below, to be approved by the university as a valid graduation project.

                        If a potential project is missing competencies - I am able to mediate a discussion with a mentor to discover any adjustments to account for the missing competencies.
