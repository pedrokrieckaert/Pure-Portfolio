                        A large school project during the spring module of my 2nd year at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. This would officially be our first project where we’d collaborate with clients and stakeholders. Our clients for the project was De Boekenberg - a library in the Dutch city of Spijkenisse - and Probiblio, the library manager within the North and South Holland provinces. We were tasked with designing a space that would motivate teens to use the library - with a focus on getting them to read more and interact with each other. This physical space could also motivate students to use the other offerings of the library, like seminars or workshops - that the library hosts.

                        The design we delivered was the physical space combined with a moderation system tied to user reading. The space was designed as a reward to the user group for continuous reading - which was monitored on a companion app. The app itself would not police the user on their reading progress, they would be trusted to manage this themselves. Within the app, the user would be able to earn a currency that would be exchanged for time within the reward space. It would also track the time they’re spending within the space and provide context sensitive feedback to ensure they don’t violate their earned time.

                        The physical reward space was designed to be an arcade - with physical game cabinets and tables - with several approaches to entertainment. The approaches were: educational games for academic focused users, co-operative/competitive games for the challenge focused users, and a selection of classic arcade games for all the in-between users.
                        <br>The space design also included a large monitor, it would display a leaderboard associated with challenge/tournament of the week. Users would have to work towards the challenge over the week to achieve a spot on the leaderboard.

                        Empathising with the user group was challenging because we began the project at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdowns. The result was that contacting locations where teens usually gather - such as schools - were closed. This meant several techniques - like observations - weren’t available and we had to adapt whatever we could use to an online context. Ultimately we acquired sufficient actionable data to continue with the project.

                        We processed the data by breaking them down into personas which helped simplify the vast variety of teens into an actionable average. The personas would be further used to develop user journeys and experience maps. Lastly, the personas would continuously be referred to throughout the project as a touch point to roughly determine if what is being done satisfies the user group.

                        This phase followed a set structure with expected sequential use of certain techniques. Based on the data, we developed several disconnected feature ideas. These would be combined or adjusted into concepts for the client to provide feedback on and select a preference to continue the project. We concluded this phase moving forward with our reward space concept and companion app.

                        During this phase, the pandemic regulation measures started easing up, which allowed us to visit the library and meet the clients in person. Preferably, we would have done this at the beginning of the project - especially since we’ve completed our research and have begun developing concepts - meaning it was difficult to address new information back into the ideas. However, the visit was fruitful as we were able to discuss the values and goals of the library.

                        This phase followed a pseudo-scrum structure - pseudo because we haven’t been properly instructed on how to do scrum at this point - starting our designs and prototypes based on the description of our concept. We’d then user test the designs, review the feedback and design another iteration. We also had input from our lecturers to better satisfy the requirements of the assignment as well.

                        This was one of the most challenging and longest assignments that I had the pleasure to work on. A notable challenge was the balance of expectations between teachers and clients; inspirations from the client would conflict with the educational goals of the assignment. We addressed this with a lot of discussion between both parties to determine a direction satisfactory to both ends.

                        By far the biggest challenge we addressed this project was the pandemic itself. Not only did it severely affect our research and testing opportunities - it also hampered our work potential. By this point - in the pandemic - my project group had already determined that the online working environment was hampering our ability to collaborate. Naturally we held group calls and frequent text messages, but it lacked an energy that in real life group work offered in spades. Since this project, I’ve made efforts to organize locations and options for in-real life group work. I’ve found that the creative process becomes faster and yields greater results.
